# Viva Bem System
Project that was made in group, with my college partners:

Alessandra Souza; <br>
Arthur Amaral; <br>
Ian Guelman; <br>
Nicolau Machado.

Basically, the program works like a clinic system that registers doctor's appointments, patients and doctors. It has been proposed to be saved to local storage using the 'struct' of the C language. 

We also use the CodeBlocks as IDE.
