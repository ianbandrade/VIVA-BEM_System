# Viva Bem System
Project that was made in group, with my college partners:

Alessandra Souza
Arthur Amaral
Ian Guelman
Nicolau

Basically, the program works like a clinic system that registers doctor's appointments, patients and doctors. It has been proposed to be saved to local storage using the 'struct' of the C language.
